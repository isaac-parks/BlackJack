### Original

Blackjack game made using good ol' HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

Completing this project was a huge deal for me. It was the first "major" project I created with no outside resources, completely from scratch.
As a kid, I always plaeyd video games, which is why I chose to go with an 8-bit theme. This project means a lot to me - it's a combination of the old, nostalgic joy I felt completing levels in those old video games, with a new found joy of coding and creating!

When I started this project I first looked at the main components of a blackjack game - which are the fact that you have a player, a dealer, and that you are always comparing those hands to that magic number "21."
To represent this, I used obejcts to represent the player/dealer, assigned properties they both had in common (such as storing their respetive hands in an array),
and did the same with methods.

Take a look at the code and enjoy! Don't go broke ðŸ˜Š.
